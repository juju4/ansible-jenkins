## FAQ

* (WIP) To connect Jenkins to GitHub
recover jenkins user ssh key (/home/jenkins/.ssh/) and add it to GitHub
validate with ```ssh -T git@github.com``` (https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/)
For one project, add your server url http://jenkins.example.com/github-webhook to Settings: Integration & Services: Jenkins (GitHub plugin)
https://blog.bartbania.com/docker/jenkins-github-docker/
Add it in Jenkins: Configure: GitHub: GitHub server with credentials as secret text (copy GitHub Token here)
Check if working, after a new push or using GitHub 'Test service' option, you should match in nginx log 'POST /github-webhook'

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* Reset user password
Edit /var/lib/jenkins/users/<user>/config.xml and remove content of passwordHash.
Alternative is to disable security in jenkins but it open all access to everyone: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Disable+security

* Check /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log for
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Builds+failing+with+OutOfMemoryErrors

* If you use node install through ssh and you have build using ssh (eg svn+ssh), you are advise to use separate key to separate risks.

* Chunk error
```SEVERE: I/O error in channel Chunked connection to http://localhost:8080/cli
java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 0A0A0A0A
```
=
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23232
possible fix TCP port for JNLP agents (fixed value, not random, not disabled)

* No X-Jenkins-CLI2-Port
```
java.io.IOException: No X-Jenkins-CLI2-Port among [X-Jenkins, null, Date, X-Hudson-Theme, X-Hudson, Content-Length, Expires, X-Jenkins-Session, Set-Cookie, Content-Type, Server, X-Content-Type-Options, Cache-Control]
```

check also which url path is correct / or /jenkins

* Jenkins Github hook
jenkins.log:
```
